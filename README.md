# LANKA - Revolutionary Graph-Based AI Development Environment

## Overview

LANKA is a comprehensive Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) intelligence platform that transforms traditional file-based development into an intelligent, graph-based knowledge ecosystem. Every requirement, architecture decision, and line of code becomes permanent organizational intelligence that compounds over time.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up development environment
npm run setup

# Run tests
npm test

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## Development Workflow

We follow strict development practices:
- **Git Discipline**: Feature branches with PR-based merges to master
- **Testing**: BDD and TDD methodologies
- **Documentation**: Continuous updates to developer and user docs
- **Code Quality**: Automated linting, type checking, and code reviews

## Modules

### CLAUDE001 - Requirements Intelligence
Transforms business requirements into intelligent, connected knowledge assets with cross-project learning and stakeholder collaboration.

### CLAUDE002 - Architecture Intelligence
Bridges requirements to implementation with intelligent architecture design, multi-environment optimization, and technology stack selection.

### CLAUDE003 - Development Intelligence
Transforms code into organizational intelligence with AI-assisted code generation, cross-project learning, and comprehensive testing intelligence.
