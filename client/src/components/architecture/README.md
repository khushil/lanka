# Architecture Intelligence Workbench

A comprehensive suite of components for designing, analyzing, and optimizing system architectures with AI-powered recommendations.

## Components Overview

### 1. ArchitectureCanvas.tsx
Visual architecture design canvas with drag-and-drop functionality.

- Undo/redo functionality
- Real-time validation and suggestions

**Key Props:**
- `onSave?: (architecture: any) => void` - Callback when architecture is saved
- `onLoad?: () => any` - Callback for loading architecture
- `initialArchitecture?: any` - Initial architecture state

### 2. PatternLibrary.tsx
Catalog and management of architectural patterns with success metrics.

**Features:**
- Searchable pattern catalog with filtering
- Pattern categories (microservices, security, data, cloud, performance)
- Success rate tracking and usage statistics
- Pattern comparison and analytics
- One-click pattern application
- Favorites management
- Real-world examples and case studies

**Key Props:**
- `onApplyPattern: (pattern: ArchitecturePattern) => void` - Pattern application callback
- `onPatternSelect?: (pattern: ArchitecturePattern) => void` - Pattern selection callback

### 3. TechnologyStack.tsx
AI-powered technology stack recommendations based on project requirements.

**Features:**
- Requirements-based stack recommendations
- Multi-criteria analysis (cost, performance, learning curve)
- Technology trend analysis
- Stack comparison matrix
- Cost estimation and breakdown
- Market share and adoption metrics
- Interactive requirements configuration

**Key Props:**
- `onStackSelect?: (stack: TechnologyStack) => void` - Stack selection callback
- `requirements?: any` - Project requirements object

### 4. CloudOptimizer.tsx
Multi-cloud optimization with cost analysis and deployment generation.

**Features:**
- AWS, Azure, GCP service mapping
- Cost comparison across cloud providers
- Service configuration optimization
- Infrastructure as Code generation (Terraform, K8s, Docker)
- Regional deployment recommendations
- Auto-scaling and high availability options
- Security compliance configurations

**Key Props:**
- `architecture?: any` - Current architecture definition
- `onDeploymentGenerated?: (deployment: any) => void` - Deployment generation callback

### 5. DecisionRecords.tsx
Architecture Decision Records (ADR) management with stakeholder workflows.

**Features:**
- ADR creation and management
- Decision status tracking (Proposed, Under Review, Approved, Rejected)
- Stakeholder approval workflows
- Impact assessment (technical, business, timeline, cost)
- Alternative analysis
- Decision timeline visualization
- Analytics and reporting

**Key Props:**
- `projectId: string` - Project identifier
- `onDecisionCreated?: (decision: ArchitectureDecision) => void` - Decision creation callback

## GraphQL Schema

### Queries
- `GET_ARCHITECTURE_PATTERNS` - Retrieve architectural patterns with filtering
- `GET_TECHNOLOGY_STACKS` - Get technology recommendations based on requirements
- `GET_CLOUD_RECOMMENDATIONS` - Fetch cloud provider recommendations
- `GET_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS` - Load architecture decisions for a project

### Mutations
- `CREATE_ARCHITECTURE_PATTERN` - Create new architectural pattern
- `GENERATE_INFRASTRUCTURE_CODE` - Generate deployment scripts
- `CREATE_ARCHITECTURE_DECISION` - Create new architecture decision record
- `UPDATE_ARCHITECTURE_DECISION` - Update existing decision record

## Integration

The components are integrated in `/src/pages/Architecture.tsx` with:

1. **Split-pane layout** with tools sidebar and main canvas
2. **Pattern library sidebar** for quick access to patterns
3. **Technology recommendations panel** for stack guidance
4. **Cloud optimization dashboard** for deployment planning
5. **Decision records integration** for governance

## Usage Example

```tsx
import {
  ArchitectureCanvas,
  PatternLibrary,
  TechnologyStack,
  CloudOptimizer,
  DecisionRecords
} from './components/architecture';

const ArchitectureWorkbench = () => {
  const [architecture, setArchitecture] = useState(null);
  
  const handlePatternApply = (pattern) => {
    // Apply pattern to current architecture
    const updatedArchitecture = applyPattern(architecture, pattern);
    setArchitecture(updatedArchitecture);
  };

  return (
    <Box sx={{ display: 'flex', height: '100vh' }}>
      <PatternLibrary onApplyPattern={handlePatternApply} />
      <ArchitectureCanvas
        initialArchitecture={architecture}
        onSave={setArchitecture}
      />
      <CloudOptimizer
        architecture={architecture}
        onDeploymentGenerated={(deployment) => {
          console.log('Generated deployment:', deployment);
        }}
      />
    </Box>
  );
};
```
