# LANKA Solution Architecture Intelligence Framework
## CLAUDE002.md - Intelligent Architecture Design with Cross-Environment Optimization

## Project Vision

Build the Solution Architecture Intelligence module of LANKA - a revolutionary system that transforms architecture design from static documentation into a dynamic, learning organizational capability. This module bridges requirements (CLAUDE001) with development implementation (CLAUDE003) by providing intelligent architecture design, multi-environment optimization, and technology stack selection based on organizational learning and proven patterns.

- **Architecture designs stay synchronized** with requirements, implementation, and operational reality
- **Proven patterns automatically adapt** to cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments  
- **Technology decisions are data-driven** based on organizational success patterns and real-world performance
- **Architecture expertise multiplies** across teams through intelligent pattern matching and adaptation
- **System designs improve continuously** through feedback from implementation and operational outcomes
