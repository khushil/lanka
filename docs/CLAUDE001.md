# LANKA Requirements Engineering Framework
## CLAUDE001.md - Intelligent Requirements Management with Cross-Project Learning

## Project Vision

Build the foundational Requirements Engineering module of LANKA - a revolutionary graph-based requirements management system that transforms business requirements into intelligent, connected knowledge assets. This module establishes the core framework for organizational requirements intelligence while setting up integration points for solution architecture and development phases.

## The Requirements Revolution

Traditional requirements management treats requirements as isolated documents that become outdated and disconnected from implementation. LANKA Requirements Engineering transforms requirements into a **living knowledge ecosystem** where:

- **Every requirement becomes a permanent strategic asset** that compounds organizational intelligence
- **Business knowledge flows seamlessly** across projects, teams, and organizational boundaries  
- **AI assistance is contextual and learning-based** rather than generic and disconnected
- **Stakeholder expertise multiplies** through intelligent pattern matching and collaboration
- **Requirements quality improves continuously** through cross-project learning and validation

## Core Requirements Intelligence Framework
