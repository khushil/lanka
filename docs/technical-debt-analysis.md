- **Suggestion**: Replace with proper logging framework

## Dependency Health Analysis

### Outdated Dependencies
- **Critical Updates Needed**: 19 packages
- **Major Version Updates**: 
  - `@apollo/server`: 4.12.2 → 5.0.0 (Breaking changes)
  - `@neo4j/graphql`: 5.12.8 → 7.2.10 (Breaking changes)
  - `openai`: 4.104.0 → 5.16.0 (Breaking changes)
- **Security Impact**: Medium
- **Effort**: 12 hours for testing and migration

### Security Vulnerabilities
- **Total Vulnerabilities**: 7 (3 low, 1 moderate, 3 high)
- **High-Risk Issues**: 3 requiring immediate attention
- **Effort**: 6 hours
- **Priority**: High

## Architecture Debt

### Type Safety Issues
- **Any Type Usage**: Limited (2 files only)
- **Status**: Good type discipline maintained
- **Risk**: Low

### Module Organization
- **Issue**: Some modules are overly complex with 10+ services
- **Risk**: Difficulty navigating and understanding module boundaries
- **Effort**: 8 hours
- **Suggestion**: Consider sub-module organization

## Test Quality Assessment

### Test Coverage
- **Test Files**: 304 test files (.test.ts/.spec.ts)
- **Coverage**: Analysis in progress (Jest execution)
- **Test Types**: Unit, Integration, E2E, BDD
- **Assessment**: Comprehensive test strategy in place

### Test Organization
- **Strengths**: 
  - Multiple test types (unit, integration, e2e, bdd)
  - Test factories and fixtures
  - Performance and load testing
- **Areas for Improvement**: 
  - Some test files may need complexity reduction

## Performance Hotspots

### Large Method Complexity
- **Pattern**: Functions with high cyclomatic complexity in large services
- **Impact**: Difficult to test, maintain, and debug
- **Files**: Services with 1000+ lines likely contain complex methods
- **Effort**: 16 hours

### File I/O Patterns
- **Observation**: Heavy use of file system operations in code generation
- **Risk**: Performance bottlenecks in CI/CD pipelines
- **Suggestion**: Implement caching and async processing

## Technical Debt Register

|----------|----------|-------|----------------|--------------|------|
| 1 | Size | Large service classes | 9 | 54 | High |
| 2 | Security | Dependency vulnerabilities | Multiple | 6 | High |
| 3 | Dependencies | Major version updates | Package.json | 12 | Medium |
| 4 | Implementation | TODO/FIXME items | 50+ files | 24 | Medium |
| 5 | Logging | Console.log usage | 69 files | 4 | Low |
| 6 | Architecture | Module complexity | 3 modules | 8 | Medium |
| 7 | Performance | Method complexity | Large services | 16 | Medium |
| 8 | Maintainability | File organization | Project structure | 8 | Low |

## Remediation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Issues (Weeks 1-2)
1. **Address security vulnerabilities** (6 hours)
   - Update packages with high-risk vulnerabilities
   - Run security audit and penetration testing

2. **Break down largest services** (54 hours)
   - Start with development-workflow.service.ts
   - Extract orchestration, execution, and validation concerns
   - Implement dependency injection for new services

### Phase 2: Dependency Management (Week 3)
1. **Major dependency updates** (12 hours)
   - Create migration plan for breaking changes
   - Update Apollo Server, Neo4j GraphQL, OpenAI SDK
   - Comprehensive testing after updates

### Phase 3: Code Quality (Weeks 4-5)
1. **TODO/FIXME resolution** (24 hours)
   - Prioritize memory system TODOs
   - Complete template engine implementations
   - Establish vector database connections

2. **Logging improvements** (4 hours)
   - Replace console statements with Winston logger
   - Implement structured logging

### Phase 4: Architecture Optimization (Week 6)
