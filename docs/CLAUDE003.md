# LANKA Development Intelligence Framework
## CLAUDE003.md - Intelligent Implementation with Cross-Project Code Learning

## Project Vision

Build the Development Intelligence module of LANKA - a revolutionary system that transforms code development from isolated file editing into an intelligent, learning organizational capability. This module completes the SDLC intelligence trilogy by bridging architecture designs (CLAUDE002) to working implementations while establishing comprehensive testing, quality, and operational intelligence that learns from every line of code written across the organization.

## The Development Revolution

Traditional development treats code as text files with limited reuse and disconnected from business intent. LANKA Development Intelligence transforms development into a **living knowledge ecosystem** where:

- **Every implementation becomes organizational knowledge** that improves future development efforts
- **Code exists as intelligent nodes** with semantic understanding, not just text in files
- **Developer intent is preserved** alongside implementation for future learning and adaptation
- **Testing and quality become predictive** through pattern recognition and cross-project learning
- **Development velocity accelerates** through intelligent code generation and proven pattern application
