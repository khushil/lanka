Feature: Architecture Intelligence Management
  As a solution architect
  I want to manage architecture decisions intelligently
  So that I can design optimal systems based on organizational learning

  Background:
    Given the LANKA system is initialized
    And I am authenticated as a solution architect
    And there are existing requirements in the system

  Scenario: Create architecture decision from requirements
    Given I have approved requirements for "User Authentication System"
    When I create an architecture decision
    Then the system should suggest relevant architecture patterns
    And the system should recommend technology stacks
    And the system should provide cost estimates
    And the decision should be linked to the requirements

  Scenario: Multi-environment optimization
    Given I have an architecture decision for "Microservices API"
    When I request optimization for "AWS" and "Azure" environments
    Then the system should provide platform-specific service mappings
    And the system should calculate comparative costs
    And the system should identify compliance requirements per environment
    And the system should suggest optimal resource allocation

  Scenario: Technology stack intelligence
    Given I need to select technologies for "Real-time Data Processing"
    When I request technology recommendations
    Then the system should analyze past successful implementations
    And the system should consider team expertise
    And the system should evaluate compatibility with existing systems
    And the system should provide performance benchmarks

  Scenario: Pattern library management
    Given multiple successful architecture implementations exist
    When I request architecture patterns for "E-commerce Platform"
    Then the system should extract proven patterns
    And patterns should include success metrics
    And patterns should have applicability conditions
    And patterns should provide adaptation guidelines

  Scenario: Architecture decision validation
    Given I have designed an architecture for "Payment Processing System"
    When I request architecture validation
    Then the system should check against non-functional requirements
    And the system should identify potential security vulnerabilities
    And the system should validate scalability characteristics
    And the system should assess cost efficiency

  Scenario: Cross-project architecture learning
    Given an architecture pattern was successful in "Project Alpha"
    When "Project Beta" has similar requirements
    Then the system should recommend the proven architecture
    And the system should highlight necessary adaptations
    And the system should connect with domain experts
    And the system should track reuse effectiveness
