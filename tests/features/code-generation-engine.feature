Feature: Code Generation Engine Intelligence
  As a software developer
  I want to generate code automatically from requirements and architecture
  So that I can accelerate development while maintaining quality standards

  Background:
    Given the LANKA system is initialized
    And I am authenticated as a software developer
    And there are approved requirements in the system
    And there are approved architecture decisions in the system

  Scenario: Generate code from functional requirements
    Given I have a functional requirement "Create user registration API"
    And I have an architecture decision for "RESTful API with Express.js"
    When I request code generation for the requirement
    Then the system should generate TypeScript API endpoint code
    And the code should include proper error handling
    And the code should include input validation
    And the code should follow architectural patterns
    And the code should include comprehensive JSDoc documentation
    And the generated code should pass static analysis

  Scenario: Generate code with multiple technology stacks
    Given I have a requirement "User profile management"
    And I have architecture decisions for "Frontend React" and "Backend Node.js"
    When I request full-stack code generation
    Then the system should generate React components for the frontend
    And the system should generate Node.js API endpoints for the backend
    And the system should generate database models and migrations
    And the system should ensure consistent data contracts between layers
    And all generated code should follow team coding standards

  Scenario: Code generation with design patterns
    Given I have a requirement "Payment processing system"
    And I have an architecture decision using "Strategy Pattern" and "Factory Pattern"
    When I request code generation with pattern implementation
    Then the system should generate code implementing the Strategy pattern
    And the system should generate code implementing the Factory pattern
    And the patterns should be properly integrated
    And the code should include pattern-specific documentation
    And the code should demonstrate pattern usage examples

  Scenario: Generate code with quality constraints
    Given I have a requirement "High-performance data processing"
    And I have quality constraints "Response time < 100ms" and "Memory usage < 500MB"
    When I request optimized code generation
    Then the system should generate performance-optimized code
    And the code should include memory management best practices
    And the code should implement efficient algorithms
    And the code should include performance monitoring hooks
    And the generated code should meet specified quality thresholds

  Scenario: Incremental code generation
    Given I have existing generated code for "User management"
    And I have a new requirement "Add user profile picture upload"
    When I request incremental code generation
    Then the system should analyze existing code structure
    And the system should generate compatible additions
    And the system should avoid breaking existing functionality
    And the system should suggest refactoring opportunities
    And the integration should maintain code consistency

  Scenario: Generate code with security requirements
    Given I have a requirement "Secure user authentication"
    And I have security constraints "OWASP compliance" and "JWT token security"
    When I request secure code generation
    Then the system should generate code with proper input sanitization
    And the code should implement secure password hashing
    And the code should include JWT token validation
    And the code should follow OWASP security guidelines
    And the code should include security testing hooks

  Scenario: Code generation with existing codebase integration
    Given I have an existing codebase "E-commerce platform"
    And I have a new requirement "Add product recommendation engine"
    When I request code generation for integration
    Then the system should analyze existing code patterns
    And the system should generate compatible code structure
    And the system should identify required dependencies
    And the system should suggest database schema updates
    And the integration should maintain existing API contracts

  Scenario: Generate code with accessibility requirements
    Given I have a requirement "Accessible user interface"
    And I have accessibility constraints "WCAG 2.1 AA compliance"
    When I request accessible code generation
    Then the system should generate semantic HTML markup
    And the code should include proper ARIA attributes
    And the code should implement keyboard navigation
    And the code should include screen reader compatibility
    And the code should pass accessibility validation tools

  Scenario Outline: Language-specific code generation
    Given I have a requirement "<requirement>"
    And I have an architecture decision for "<language>" and "<framework>"
    When I request language-specific code generation
    Then the system should generate idiomatic "<language>" code
    And the code should use "<framework>" best practices
    And the code should include language-specific error handling
    And the code should follow "<language>" naming conventions

    Examples:
      | requirement              | language   | framework      |
      | REST API development     | TypeScript | Express.js     |
      | Web application frontend | JavaScript | React          |
      | Data processing service  | Python     | FastAPI        |
      | Mobile app backend       | Java       | Spring Boot    |
      | Microservice API         | Go         | Gin            |

  Scenario: Code generation error handling
    Given I have an invalid requirement "Undefined business logic"
    When I request code generation
    Then the system should detect requirement incompleteness
    And the system should provide specific improvement suggestions
    And the system should request missing information
    And the system should not generate incomplete code
    And the system should log the generation attempt for learning

  Scenario: Code generation with team preferences
    Given I have a requirement "User notification system"
    And my team has preferences "Functional programming style" and "Test-driven development"
    When I request team-aligned code generation
    Then the system should generate functional programming patterns
    And the system should include comprehensive test cases
    And the code should follow team's established conventions
    And the code should include TDD-friendly structure
    And the generation should respect team's architectural decisions

  Scenario: Code generation performance optimization
    Given I have a requirement "Real-time chat application"
    And I have performance targets "Handle 10,000 concurrent connections"
    When I request performance-optimized code generation
    Then the system should generate asynchronous processing code
    And the code should implement connection pooling
    And the code should include performance monitoring
    And the code should use efficient data structures
    And the system should provide performance benchmark estimates
