Feature: Cross-Module Development Integration
  As a system architect
  I want seamless integration between Requirements, Architecture, and Development modules
  So that I can ensure consistent and traceable software delivery

  Background:
    Given the LANKA system is initialized
    And all modules (Requirements, Architecture, Development) are active
    And I am authenticated as a system architect
    And there are sample projects with cross-module dependencies

  Scenario: End-to-end requirement to code generation flow
    Given I have a business requirement "Implement multi-factor authentication"
    When the requirement is approved and classified
    Then the Architecture module should suggest MFA patterns
    And the Architecture module should recommend security frameworks
    When I approve the architecture decision
    Then the Development module should generate MFA implementation code
    And the Development module should generate security tests
    And all artifacts should maintain traceability links

  Scenario: Architecture decision impact on development tasks
    Given I have an approved requirement "Real-time chat functionality"
    And I have an architecture decision "Use WebSocket with Redis pub/sub"
    When the architecture decision is finalized
    Then the Development module should create implementation tasks
    And tasks should include "WebSocket server setup"
    And tasks should include "Redis integration"
    And tasks should include "Real-time message handling"
    And task estimates should reflect architectural complexity

  Scenario: Requirements change propagation across modules
    Given I have an existing requirement "Basic user profile management"
    And there are approved architecture decisions and generated code
    When I modify the requirement to "Advanced user profile with social features"
    Then the system should analyze impact on existing architecture
    And the system should suggest architecture modifications
    And the system should identify code that needs updating
    And the system should create change management workflows

  Scenario: Cross-module consistency validation
    Given I have requirements specifying "GDPR compliance for user data"
    And I have architecture decisions for "Data encryption and audit trails"
    When I generate code for user data handling
    Then the Development module should validate GDPR compliance
    And the generated code should implement required encryption
    And the generated code should include audit logging
    And the system should verify end-to-end compliance alignment

  Scenario: Pattern reuse across project lifecycle
    Given a previous project successfully implemented "OAuth2 integration pattern"
    And the pattern is stored in the Architecture pattern library
    When a new requirement "Third-party login integration" is created
    Then the Requirements module should suggest the proven approach
    And the Architecture module should recommend the stored pattern
    And the Development module should generate code using the pattern
    And the system should track pattern reuse effectiveness

  Scenario: Quality attribute propagation
    Given I have a non-functional requirement "System must handle 10,000 concurrent users"
    When the Architecture module designs for scalability
    And the Development module generates implementation code
    Then the generated code should include performance optimizations
    And the code should implement proper connection pooling
    And the code should include performance monitoring hooks
    And the system should generate load testing configurations

  Scenario: Knowledge transfer between modules
    Given the Requirements module identifies a new pattern "Multi-tenant data isolation"
    When similar requirements are encountered in other projects
    Then the Architecture module should access requirement pattern knowledge
    And the Architecture module should suggest proven architectural solutions
    And the Development module should generate multi-tenant aware code
    And all modules should contribute to organizational learning

  Scenario: Compliance requirements end-to-end implementation
    Given I have compliance requirements "SOX financial data handling"
    And regulatory constraints "Data retention for 7 years" and "Audit trail required"
    When the system processes these requirements across modules
    Then the Requirements module should classify as compliance requirements
    And the Architecture module should suggest compliant data architecture
    And the Development module should generate compliant data handling code
    And the system should ensure compliance verification at each stage

  Scenario: Stakeholder collaboration across modules
    Given I have stakeholders from "Business", "Architecture", and "Development" teams
    And there is a complex requirement "Payment processing with multiple providers"
    When stakeholders collaborate on the requirement
    Then the Requirements module should capture all stakeholder inputs
    And the Architecture module should involve architects in decision-making
    And the Development module should consider developer constraints
    And the system should maintain collaboration history and decisions

  Scenario: Cross-module impact analysis
    Given I have an established system with requirements, architecture, and code
    When I need to assess impact of "New data privacy regulations"
    Then the system should analyze requirements that need updates
    And the system should identify architecture components requiring changes
    And the system should pinpoint code modules needing modification
    And the system should provide comprehensive change impact reports

  Scenario: Module data consistency and synchronization
    Given multiple users are working simultaneously across different modules
    When User A updates requirements while User B modifies architecture
    And User C is generating code from related components
    Then the system should maintain data consistency
    And the system should handle concurrent modifications gracefully
    And the system should notify users of conflicting changes
    And the system should provide conflict resolution mechanisms

  Scenario: Cross-module testing and validation
    Given I have generated code from requirements and architecture decisions
    When I run comprehensive system validation
    Then the system should verify requirements coverage in code
    And the system should validate architecture compliance in implementation
    And the system should check for missing functionality
    And the system should generate traceability reports
    And the system should identify gaps in implementation

  Scenario: Performance optimization across modules
    Given I have performance requirements "Sub-second response time"
    And architecture decisions favoring "Microservices with caching"
    When the Development module generates implementation
    Then the generated code should implement efficient algorithms
    And the code should include caching strategies from architecture
    And the code should meet performance requirements from requirements
    And the system should generate performance validation tests

  Scenario: Security requirements end-to-end implementation
    Given I have security requirements "Zero-trust security model"
    And architecture decisions for "API Gateway with mTLS"
    When the Development module implements security measures
    Then the generated code should implement zero-trust principles
    And the code should include mTLS certificate handling
    And the code should implement proper authentication flows
    And the system should generate security testing suites

  Scenario: Documentation generation across modules
    Given I have complete requirements, architecture, and code for a feature
    When I request comprehensive documentation generation
    Then the system should generate requirement specification documents
    And the system should create architecture decision records (ADRs)
    And the system should produce code documentation and API specs
    And all documentation should maintain cross-references
    And the documentation should be version-controlled and traceable

  Scenario: Module health monitoring and alerts
    Given the system is processing requirements, architecture, and development tasks
    When there are issues or bottlenecks in any module
    Then the system should monitor cross-module performance
    And the system should alert on module integration failures
    And the system should provide module health dashboards
    And the system should suggest optimization recommendations
    And the system should maintain system-wide operational metrics

  Scenario Outline: Cross-module workflow automation
    Given I have a "<project_type>" project with "<complexity>" requirements
    When I initiate end-to-end workflow automation
    Then the system should coordinate "<requirements_tasks>" in Requirements module
    And the system should execute "<architecture_tasks>" in Architecture module
    And the system should perform "<development_tasks>" in Development module
    And the workflow should complete within "<expected_duration>"

    Examples:
      | project_type | complexity | requirements_tasks | architecture_tasks | development_tasks | expected_duration |
      | Web App      | Simple     | Classification     | Pattern matching   | Code generation   | 30 minutes        |
      | Microservice | Medium     | Analysis + Validation | Decision + Patterns | Code + Tests     | 2 hours           |
      | Enterprise   | Complex    | Full analysis      | Complete design    | Full implementation | 1 day           |
      | Mobile App   | Medium     | Platform analysis  | Mobile architecture | Native code gen   | 4 hours           |
