Feature: Requirements Intelligence Management
  As a business analyst
  I want to manage requirements intelligently
  So that I can leverage organizational knowledge and improve requirement quality

  Background:
    Given the LANKA system is initialized
    And I am authenticated as a business analyst

  Scenario: Create a new requirement with AI assistance
    Given I have a business need "User authentication system"
    When I submit the requirement to LANKA
    Then the system should classify it as a "Functional Requirement"
    And the system should suggest similar requirements from other projects
    And the system should validate the requirement completeness
    And the requirement should be stored in the graph database

  Scenario: Discover similar requirements across projects
    Given there are existing requirements in the system
    When I create a requirement "OAuth2 integration for third-party login"
    Then the system should find similar OAuth requirements from other projects
    And the system should show their implementation success rates
    And the system should provide adaptation guidelines

  Scenario: Requirements conflict detection
    Given I have an existing requirement "Maximum response time of 100ms"
    When I add a conflicting requirement "Support for complex data processing"
    Then the system should detect the potential conflict
    And the system should suggest resolution strategies
    And the system should notify relevant stakeholders

  Scenario: Requirements pattern extraction
    Given multiple successful projects have been completed
    When I request requirement patterns for "e-commerce checkout"
    Then the system should extract common requirement patterns
    And the patterns should include success metrics
    And the patterns should be available as templates

  Scenario: Cross-project knowledge sharing
    Given a requirement "GDPR compliance for user data"
    When another project creates a similar compliance requirement
    Then the system should recommend the proven approach
    And the system should identify the domain expert
    And the system should facilitate knowledge transfer
